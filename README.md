# graphql_examples

Compare different implementations of GraphQL on the server side. A bit like TodoMVC, but
with a different example, showing features of GraphQL and how to implement them in various
languages and frameworks.

## Where to find implementations?

In the `examples` folder of this repository, named by convention `language_framework_library`
(examples: `ruby_on_rails_ruby_graphql`, `rust_juniper`).

## Application to build

A minimalist post system, Ã  la Facebook, with users, posts, comments and a possibility
to _like_ the posts.

### Data Model

![Data model](out/model/Models.png)

A post

- belongs to a user
- has many likes
- may belong to a parent post, if its a comment

A like

- belongs to a post
- belongs to a user

A user

- has many posts
- has many likes

### GraphQL Schema

#### Query Object

#### Mutations

### Goals

#### Avoid N+1 Queries to the Database

Use batch loading when available to the language and framework of choice.

## Misc

### Generate PlantUML Diagrams as Images

At this moment, generating them using the [_PlantUML_ plugin of _VSCode_](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jebbs.plantuml),
calling the _PlantUML: Export Workspace Diagrams_ command, and choosing _png_.

## Tests

An implementation agnostic test suite, in _JavaScript_, is in `tests`.

To execute, set the `EXAMPLE` environment variable to the directory name
you want to test (subdirectory of `examples`) and call `yarn mocha` from
the `tests` directory.

```bash
EXAMPLE=ruby_on_rails_ruby_graphql yarn test
```

For watch file and only execute a single file on save:

```bash
EXAMPLE=ruby_on_rails_ruby_graphql yarn watch
```

## Service Dependencies

A _Docker Compose_ file is provided. All required database and other
services are included in.

```bash
docker-compose up
```

### Docker & docker-compose

#### Linux

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y docker docker-compose
```

#### macOS
