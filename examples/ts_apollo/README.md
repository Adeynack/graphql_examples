## DevOps

### Database / Models

Using [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started) as the ORM.

#### History of Commands

```bash
yarn add -D prisma
npx prisma init
```

Created new database in `psql` using the one generated by `examples/rails`.

```sql
create database ts_apollo_development with template ruby_on_rails_ruby_graphql_development;
```

Generate the first _Prisma_ skeleton using existing structure.

```bash
npx prisma db pull
```

## Problems & Solutions

### Generated Type Force Complete Resolution Of Objects

By default, the types generated are "complete", meaning that for the GraphQL type `User!`, every field has to be resolved directly in the generator method. However, _Apollo Server_ allows a type to be resolved by its resolver class. Example: the root query resolver has a `user(id: ID!): User!` attribute, and a `User` has `posts: [Post!]!`. The generated types will force you to provide the `posts` values. Doing so at the root level is not desired, as we do not even know if that information was selected in the actual query. _Apollo Server_ allows those attribute to simply not be defined, telling it to go to the next resolver step in the chain (example: `const userResolvers: UserResolvers`).

For this to work properly with the _TypeScript_ generated types, we should be allowed to return a `Partial<User>` without failing to type-check.

See [this section](https://the-guild.dev/blog/better-type-safety-for-resolvers-with-graphql-codegen#whats-next) of the `graphql-codegen` documentation. In `codegen.ts` (or `.yaml` or `.js` or `.json`), inside of the `config` element, add `defaultMapper: 'Partial<{T}>'`.
